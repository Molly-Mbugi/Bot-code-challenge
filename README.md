## Description
# React Immersive Code Challenge: Bot Battlr
* As a user, I should be able to:
* See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection
* Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the  YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.
*     Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component.
* Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.

* Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking on the card should instead display a show view (BotSpecs) for that bot, which should be on a new page i.e when a user clicks on the bot, it should redirect them to bots/:botId page. BotSpecs should have two buttons

* Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component, SortBar.
* When I enlist a bot it will be removed from the BotCollection and added to YourBotArmy.
* Filter bots by their class. We can select a few filters at the same time.
* Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component, SortBar.
    Only enlist one bot from each bot_class. The classes are ["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"].
